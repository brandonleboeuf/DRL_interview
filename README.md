Make an API request to get a list of users from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users (no authentication is required)

Notes:
-- The 1st column displays the name and email address of each user, the two fields are separated by “ | “.
-- The end column displays the phone number. The element containing the phone number has a rounded border and “#” close to its left side.
-- In phone numbers the "(" and ")" characters (parentheses) need to be replaced with dashes (“-”).
-- Do not display users whose name starts with ‘M’ or ‘K’.
-- The phone numbers should look like clickable links.

3. Concatenate the users displayed in the table with the first 2 elements of the list of all users. Below the table display the names of the users from the final concatenated array, comma-delimited.
